	 development process. The ability to use JS for both the 
	 backend and the frontend inspires me to do this, because I 
	 can dive deeper while focusing on one language. Mainly 
	 interested in creating websites and applications. In the 
	 future, I wanna participate in the creation of AI web 
	 applications. It is a long way, but why not if there
	 is a lifetime. Waiting for new acquaintances and profitable
	  offers.</h1>
