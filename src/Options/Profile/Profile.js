	 entire stack to understand the overall
	 development process. The 
	 ability to use JS for both the backend and the frontend 
	 inspires me to do this because I can dive deeper by focusing
	  on one language. Mainly interested in creating websites 
	  and applications. In the future, I want to take part in 
	  the creation of web applications with artificial intelligence.
	 Waiting for new acquaintances and profitable offers.</h1>
